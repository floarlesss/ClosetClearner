Cool little Discord bot I made for my friend's server. It has a list of rules that I'm going to try and make editable xD.
Anyway, that list allows for the slash commands that repeats a rule by providing the bot with a rule number.

And It can also detect when a user on YouTube has uploaded a new video, and if they have it'll send a message in a announcement for that purpose.
